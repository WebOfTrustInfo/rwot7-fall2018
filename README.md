## Rebooting the Web of Trust VII: Toronto (September 2018)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT7, the seventh
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which is to run in the
Toronto area on September 26th-September 28th, 2018. The goal of the
workshop is to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals
on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on
the future.

website](http://www.weboftrust.info/) for more information about our
community. Please visit [Eventbrite](https://rwot7.eventbrite.com/) to register._

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

This should be uploaded to [Topics & Advance Readings directory](topics-and-advance-readings).

Here are the advanced readings to date:
    *[Cryptocurrency wallets as an application of Functional Identity](https://github.com/WebofTrustInfo/rwot7-fall2018/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/Cryptocurrency%20wallets%20a%20an%20application%20of%20Functional%20Identity.md) by Mikerah Quintyne-Collins and Abdulwasay Mehar
